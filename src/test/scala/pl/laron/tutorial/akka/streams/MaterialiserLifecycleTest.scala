/**
  * https://blog.colinbreck.com/integrating-akka-streams-and-akka-actors-part-ii/
  * An extremely important aspect to understand is that the materialized stream is running as a set of actors
  * on the threads of the execution context on which they were allocated.
  * In other words, the stream is running independently from the actor that allocated it.
  * This becomes very important if the stream is long-running, or even infinite,
  * and we want the actor to manage the life-cycle of the stream,
  * such that when the actor stops, the stream is terminated.
  * Expanding on the example above, I will make the stream infinite and use a KillSwitch to manage the life-cycle of the stream.
  *
  * From ActorMaterializer docu.
  * The required [[akka.actor.ActorRefFactory]] (which can be either an [[akka.actor.ActorSystem]] or an [[akka.actor.ActorContext]])
  * * will be used to create one actor that in turn creates actors for the transformation steps.
  * *
  * * The materializer's [[akka.stream.ActorMaterializerSettings]] will be obtained from the
  * * configuration of the `context`'s underlying [[akka.actor.ActorSystem]].
  * *
  * * The `namePrefix` is used as the first part of the names of the actors running
  * * the processing steps. The default `namePrefix` is `"flow"`. The actor names are built up of
  * * `namePrefix-flowNumber-flowStepNumber-stepName`.
